## Data Sources
Crime data is provided courtesy of the CUPD, which releases daily crime logs about incidents on campus [here](https://www.colorado.edu/police/records-reports/daily-crime-log).   
Geocoding data, which allows us to turn street addresses into exact coordinates, is from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/geocoder.html) and OpenStreetMap's nifty [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) tool. 

## Other tools
Apache's [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) is used to transform the PDFs into easily-readable plaintext.   
Google Maps's nifty [API](https://developers.google.com/maps) is used to display the data after going through processing.   

## Disclaimer
This data is as up to date as we can make it, however, it is **not** guaranteed to be 100% accurate or complete.
